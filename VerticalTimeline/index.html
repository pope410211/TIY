       <h3> Gollum Wants his Precious</h3>
        <p> Antique Hobbit erat, Smeagol nomine; necavit amicum suum Deagol, cum is invenisset Anulum Unium, ad Anulum ipsum raptandum. Potestas Anuli eum corrupsit et monstrum, odium luci Solis Lunaeque habente, mutavit."

      <h3> Why So Serious? </h3>
      <p>How about a magic trick? I'm gonna make this pencil disappear. Ta-da! You wanna know how I got them? So I had a wife. She was beautiful, like you, who tells me I worry too much, who tells me I ought to smile more, who gambles and gets in deep with
        the sharks. Hey. One day they carve her face. And we have no money for surgeries. She can't take it. I just wanna see her smile again. I just want her to know that I don't care about the scars. So, I do this to myself. And you know what? She can't
        stand the sight of me. She leaves. Now I see the funny side. Now I'm always smiling.

      <p>I'm Batman

          It's ends here.

            Someone like you. Someone who'll rattle the cages.

            I just want my phone call.
